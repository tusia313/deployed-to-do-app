# 🎄 TO-DO list (full-stack Christmas edition) 

## 🍬 What's it about?
It's my final project in Annia's course, I developed a full-stack To-Do app using
Node.js and Express.js for the backend structure and authorization. For the
frontend, I used React. This project is unique in my portfolio, because it’s the only one where I
incorporated SQL (PostgreSQL). Users can create, edit, and delete their to-do
items, as well as sign up and log out of their accounts. I thoroughly enjoyed
learning about tokens and cookies and how they are utilized in a real-world
application.


## 🍬 First look 
Nothing special, just a simple table with rows and interactive buttons. The date is updated daily. Now I'm working on a pop-up modals.

This little project is part of an amazing Full Stack Developer Course created by  ♥ Ania Kubow ♥. Love this women, her sense of humor and ability to explain hard, code-things in a way that I finally understand. 🏆
