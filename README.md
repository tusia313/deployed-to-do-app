# 🎄 TO-DO list (full-stack Christmas edition) 

## 🍬 What's it about?
It's my final project in Annia's course, I developed a full-stack To-Do app using
Node.js and Express.js for the backend structure and authorization. For the
frontend I used React. 
This project is unique in my portfolio, because it’s the only one where I
incorporated SQL (PostgreSQL). Users can create, edit, and delete their to-do
items, as well as sign up and log out of their accounts. I thoroughly enjoyed
learning about tokens and cookies and how they are utilized in a real-world
application.


## 🍬 First look 
Nothing special, just a simple table with rows and interactive buttons. The date is updated daily.

The popup modal, when You can put Your task, looks like this:

## 🍬 Technologies

+ React!
+ Node.js
+ PostgresSQL

## 🍬 Inspiration
This little project is part of an amazing Full Stack Developer Course created by  ♥ Ania Kubow ♥. Love this women, her sense of humor and ability to explain hard, code-things in a way that I finally understand. 🏆

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
